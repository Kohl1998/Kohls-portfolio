# Bootstrap Portfolio Webpage

## Description

For this application I built a webpage using css bootstrap 5 to help with the structure of the page. Although, I did utilise this framework, I made sure to adapt the components such as the jumbotron, navigation bar, containers, & cards, by changing the colours of elements. Furthermore, I added links to the cards, so the user can navigate to the deployed site and see each project individually. 

Lastly, I added Font Awesome fonts to spice up the page some more and push me out of my comfort zone. 

During the process of building this application I learnt how important it is to ask for help whenever you find yourself struggling to come up with a solution, even after timeboxing yourself. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Features

For this application there is a navigation bar within the navigation bar, which you can access by clicking on any of the links to jump straight to the section of choice, which includes interactive features such as the color changing to red when user hovers over link. Also, there is the option to scroll down the page using the scroller. 

Lastly, my contact information can be accessed by clicking on the 'contact me' link in the header navigation.
